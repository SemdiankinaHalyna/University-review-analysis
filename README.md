# University-review-analysis
This project analyzes student reviews about universities. 
For privacy reasons, the universities are anonymized and referred to by numbers (e.g., University_1, University_2).  
This project is intended solely for educational and research purposes and does not represent any official evaluation or ranking of the institutions.
This project includes a demonstration of basic web scraping techniques used to collect student reviews of universities from publicly available websites.
To preserve privacy and comply with ethical standards:
•	The URLs of the data sources are intentionally omitted.
•	University names are anonymized (e.g., University_1, University_2).
•	The scraping code is presented for educational purposes only, as part of a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline.
The script extracts basic information such as:
- University name (anonymized)
- Number of reviews
- Average rating
- Individual review text, date, and star rating
