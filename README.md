## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how NLP and machine learning techniques can automate the analysis of user reviews using student feedback as a case study. It covers the complete workflow—from web scraping and data preprocessing to sentiment classification, topic modeling, and visualization—transforming unstructured text into actionable insights.

Although demonstrated using higher education reviews, the approach can be applied to customer feedback in many domains, including finance, e-commerce, healthcare, and customer support.


💡  **Note:**  
**This project demonstrates a feedback analytics methodology** using higher education reviews as an example. It is not intended to provide an official evaluation or ranking of educational institutions.  
**For privacy reasons, the universities are anonymized** and referred to by numbers (e.g., University_1, University_2).

## Business Problem

Organizations receive large volumes of user feedback through reviews and surveys. Manual analysis is time-consuming, subjective, difficult to scale and often delays the identification of recurring or emerging issues.

## Solution

Developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline that automates feedback analysis, enabling organizations to identify customer sentiment, detect recurring issues, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Expected Business Value

- Reduced manual workload in feedback analysis  
- Improved early detection of emerging issues and trends  
- Supported prioritization of product and service improvements  
- Enhanced data-driven decision-making through structured feedback insights  

## Methodology

The project follows a structured end-to-end pipeline for processing and analyzing user feedback, combining NLP and machine learning techniques.

## Key Results

- Collected and processed 6,000+ student reviews from multiple public sources. 
- Issue categories identified (Attitude Towards Students, Campus Conditions, Corruption, Academic Process Management, Education Quality)
- Developed a multi-label classification model for automatic issue detection (F1 micro = 0.79) and demonstrated reliable performance across major issue categories.
- Built an interactive dashboard for monitoring sentiment, comparing universities and tracking issue trends.

## Key Dashboard Insights

### Sentiment Distribution
- 🟢 **Positive:** 55.5%
- 🔴 **Negative:** 36.4%
- ⚪ **Neutral:** 8.1%

### Main Issue Areas
- Quality of education (largest share)
- Academic process management
- Attitude towards students

### Issue Distribution (Top vs Bottom)
- 📈 Quality of education: **28%** (highest)
- 📉 Campus conditions: **11%** (lowest)

### Temporal Trend (2009–2023)
- Steady increase in issue-related feedback over time

### Post-2023 Shift
- 📉 Decrease in corruption-related mentions
- 📈 Increase in academic process management concerns

## 💡 Limitations

Results should be interpreted with caution, as online reviews may not fully represent the entire student population.
The approach is most valuable when applied to large-scale feedback collected from trusted and consistent sources, such as official university feedback platforms or customer review systems maintained by organizations. In such settings, automated sentiment and topic analysis enables continuous monitoring of user feedback and early detection of emerging issues.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 📊 Integrate additional feedback sources to improve data coverage and representativeness.  
- 🧠 Expand labeled dataset to improve model performance and enable more advanced architectures such as XLM-RoBERTa.  
- ⚙️ Transition to real-time pipeline with automated data collection, inference, and dashboard updates.  
- 🚨 Implement automated monitoring and alerting for emerging issues and sentiment shifts.
